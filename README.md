# Art-Space-App-Android-Kotlin
This repository contains my implementation of the Art Space App, based on the Android Basics in Kotlin Compose - Art Space Codelab.
# About this App
An Android app showcasing a collection of famous world tourist attractions from around the world,including their images,descriptions and the author of the picture.
Users can navigate through the collection using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
# What I learned?
   * Building layouts with Jacpack Compose
   * Using state management with remember and mutableStateOf
   * Implementing when for conditional logic to manage content display
   * Gained an understanding of identifying app states and dynamically modifying them in response to user interactions, such as button taps
This project helped solidify foundational concepts in Jetpack Compose and UI design for Android development.
